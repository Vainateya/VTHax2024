Denmark introduced a Danish version of NSCP (NCSP-D) the same \nyear. In 1997, Fin",
    "land and Sweden introduced national versions (NCSP-F and NCSP-S respectively), whereas Iceland \nimplemented the Nordic (English-language) version of NCSP (NCSP-E). In 1999, Norway adopted a Norwegian version of \nNCSP (NCSP-N). Thus all five Nordic countries have used NCSP since 1999. \nA procedure for annual updating of NCSP has been established. The responsibility for updating the classification lies with \nthe Nordic Centre for Classifications in Health Care, in Oslo, Norway. The Centre maintains an electronic discussion group \nfor suggested changes and a Reference group for Nordic classification matters which makes formal recommendations as to \nchanges in the classification. The final  decisions are taken by the Board of the Nordic Centre. Information on the NCSP \nupdate routine can be found in the section on Structure and classification guidelines. The Nordic version of NCSP has been \nupdated fourteen times. NCSP Version 1.14 is effective from January 1, 2010. \nNOMESCO and the Nordic",
    " Centre decided to make new printed copies of the Nordic version of NCSP available to \ninterested parties on a print-on-demand basis. This version of NCSP 1.14 includes the original preface to the basic Nordic \nedition of NCSP as well as the guidelines on the structure and use of the classification. The body of the classification \nincorporates all fourteen updates made so far which have been fully integrated in the text. \nThe first revision consisted mainly of corrections to the original version, whereas later revisions introduce new codes which \ncan be seen as a development of the classification. These changes are based on suggestions from national classification \nauthorities and the discussion in the electronic forum. The changes introduced between the thirteenth and fourteenth \nrevisions are presented in Appendix 2. The changes in the earlier revisions are presented at the website of the Nordic Centre \n(http://www. nordclass.org). \nQuestions about the maintenance and updating proced",
    "ure should be directed to the Nordic Centre for Classifications in \nHealth Care. Requests for printed versions of NCSP should be directed to NOMESCO. The classification is also available at \nthe website of the Nordic Centre, from where it can be downloaded in PDF-format (http://www. nordclass.org) \nOslo and Copenhagen November 2009 \nArnt Ole Ree \n \n \n \nJohannes Nielsen \nHead of the Nordic Classification Centre \n \nSecretary of NOMESCO \n \n \n \n \nPREFACE \n 6 \nPreface to first edition \nAt the initiative of NOMESCO, a study comparing surgical frequencies and activities in the Nordic countries was set up in \nthe early 1980\u2019s and resulted, in 1989, in the publication of an abbreviated Nordic list of surgical procedures for Denmark, \nFinland, Norway and Sweden. \nBased on the experience gained from this work, it was decided to set up a working group, under NOMESCO, to prepare the \nstructure of a common Nordic classification for surgical procedures. \nThe following persons were appointed as member",
    "s of the Working Group: Henning Bay-Nielsen, Chairman (Denmark), \nPeter Sylvest Olsen (Denmark), Timo Niinim\u00e4ki (Finland) Steffen Birkeland (Noway), Glen Thorsen (Norway), Sven \nAschberg (Sweden) (until January 1992), Hubertus van \nPaaschen (Sweden) (since January 1992) and Bj\u00f6rn Smedby (WHO Collaborating Centre for the Classification of Diseases \nin the Nordic Countries). \nThe Working Group prepared a proposal for a Nordic classification for surgical procedures which was presented and \napproved at a Nordic seminar in November 1991. \nAt the seminar specialists in each area were appointed to prepare the chapters and as contact persons. In all approximately \n100 experts have been associated with the project. \nThe following persons have been responsible for preparing the chapters: \nSteffen Birkeland and Glen Thorsen (Norway): Structure and classification guidelines \nOlli Heiskanen (Finland): Chapter A.

    " \n \n13\nStructure and \nclassification guidelines \nIntroduction \nThe Classification of Surgical Procedures (NCSP) is based on the traditions of the surgical profession in the Nordic countries \nand reflects surgical practice in these countries in 1994. It constitutes the first common Nordic classification of surgical \nprocedures. \nIn producing this classification attention has been paid to generally accepted requirements for surgical procedure \ncomponents as seen in concurrent classification development. In addition the classification is designed to give reasonable \nscope for expansion to meet anticipated future advances in the field of surgical procedures. With these updates the NCSP is \nexpected to do good service as a regional classification for some years. \nClassification structure \nOverview \nThe NCSP consists of 15 main chapters (A-H, J-N, P-Q) of surgical procedures arranged according to functional-anatomic \nbody system, four subsidiary chapters (T, U, X, Y) containing therapeutic a",
    "nd investigative procedures associated with surgery \nand one supplementary chapter (Z). \nThe subsidiary chapters are: Minor surgical procedures (T), Transluminal endoscopy \u2013 through natural or artificial body \norifices (U), Investigative procedures connected with surgery (X), Procurement of organs and tissue for transplantation (Y). \nThe procedure codes of the main and subsidiary chapters A-Y are basic procedure codes, each assigned as a unique identifier \nto a uniquely defined procedure. The basic procedure codes include and represent all accepted surgical procedures and \nconstitute the only complete and independent procedure codes. The supplementary codes of chapter Z serve as general \nprocedure qualifiers, providing additional information to the basic procedure codes. They are always appended to basic \nprocedure codes, and may never be used alone. \nProcedure codes described \nThe NCSP codes consist of three alphabetic characters (positions 1-3 of the code) and two numeric characters ",
    "(positions 4-5 \nof the code). All upper-case characters of the English alphabet are permitted as alphabetic characters, except I and O.\nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n 14 \nThe procedure codes are independent of surgical speciality. \nDiagnostic information is excluded from procedure codes as a matter of principle, except in procedures that are unique to the \ndiagnosis, and where the diagnostic information is necessary to achieve a concise procedure designation. \nE.g.: \nFHE 00 \nTransatrial repair of tetralogy of Fallot \nFHH 10 \nExpansion of VSD in double outlet ventricle \nThe basic procedure codes will be found at only one place in the classification. The way in which a procedure is related to \nthe functional-anatomical axis determines the position of the code within the classification. In the case of exclusions cross-\nreferences to the appropriate codes, code groups or chapters will generally be given. \nIn order to relate the basic procedure codes to general patient data (e.g.",
    " age and sex, etc.), administrative data and elements \nfrom other classifications (e.g. diagnosis and histology), computer support is virtually essential. A complete sequential list of \ncodes without annotation will be supplied in text and file formats to facilitate integration into clinical computer systems. \nMain chapters A-Q \nIn the main chapters, the codes are composed as follows: \n\u2022 The first level (position 1) of the code denotes the chapter, representing in the 15 main chapters the functional-\nanatomical body system group, e.g.: A \u2013 Nervous system. \n\u2022 The second level (position 2) denotes the functional-anatomical region within the body system in question, e.g.: AA \u2013 \nSkull and intracranial structures. \n\u2022 The third level (position 3) denotes the general method of the procedure (procedure group), e.g.: AAA \u2013 Diagnostic \nintracranial procedures. \n\u2022 The numeric characters of the code, (positions 4 and 5), identify the specific procedure within the procedure group, \nincluding surgic",
    "al technique and precise anatomical location. \nWith this structure, the sequence of character positions within the code has a uniform significance throughout the 15 main \nchapters of the classification. \nSubordinate chapters T-Y \nIn the subordinate chapters, the body system, corresponding to a main chapter, and body region, corre-sponding to a main \nchapter body region group, are denoted by positions 2 and 3 of the code, e.g.: UD \u2013 Transluminal endoscopy of ear, nose \nand larynx corresponding to chapter D \u2013 Ear, nose and larynx, and UDQ \u2013 Laryngoscopy corresponding to DQ \u2013 Larynx. \nIn these chapters positions 4-5 are used to characterise method and technique (procedure) in a manner suitable to the \ncontents of the chapter. \nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n \n15\nSupplementary chapter Z \nThe supplementary codes of chapter Z are general qualifiers, applicable in principle to all main and subordinate chapters. \nThe basic procedure codes are not changed in definition or code designa",
    "tion by the addition of one or more supplementary \ncodes. \nThe character Z in position 1 of the code denotes the chapter as in all other chapters. Characters X, Z and S in position 2 of \nthe code denote unspecified region. The codes are available to characterise procedures of all other chapters. In case a group of \ncodes is specific to a main or subsidiary chapter, the second character identifies the corresponding chapter. \nAs of this updated edition, the following groups exist: \n\u2022 ZC codes specify the use of certain techniques in surgery of the eye. \n\u2022 ZF codes specify the use of certain techniques in surgery of the heart and major thoracic vessels (chapter F). \n\u2022 ZL codes specify the use of certain techniques in gynaecological surgery (chapter L). \n\u2022 ZP codes specify the use of certain techniques in surgery of peripheral vessels and lymphatic system. \n\u2022 ZQ codes specify the use of certain techniques in surgery of the skin. Includes : Subcutaneous tissue. \n\u2022 ZS codes link the present ",
    "procedure to previous surgery, with the addition of a position 3 character indicating the main or \nsubordinate chapter of previous surgery. \n\u2022 ZU codes specify the use of certain techniques in transluminal endoscopy. \n\u2022 ZX codes characterise various circumstances and events in surgery. \n\u2022 ZZ codes characterise reconstructive use of tissue: Free tissue transplants (excluding bone and tissue of the eye and orbit); \nflaps and free microvascular grafts, including composite flaps and microvascular grafts with bone. The codes specify the \nnature and origin of such transplants or flaps. Finally, there are ZZ codes for the use of tissue expanders in addition to or \nas an alternative to tissue transplantation. \nFor future editions, chapter Z groups specific to other main or subsidiary chapters may be developed. However, chapter Z \ngroups specific to chapter X are not envisaged. \nSpecific elements of the code structure \nIn all chapters except chapter Z, the use of certain characters in certain p",
    "ositions of the code carries particular significance in \nthe following manner: \n\u2022 X in position 2 denotes unspecified region within the body system in question. \n\u2022 W in position 2 denotes reoperations, without specification of region within the body system in question. \n\u2022 W in position 3 denotes possible procedure groups not presently found in the classification (\u201cOther procedure\u201d groups). \nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n 16 \n\u2022 9 in position 4 represents possible \u201cother procedures\u201d in the same manner as W in position 3 represents \u201cother procedure \ngroups\u201d. \nIn the main chapters relating to the major body cavities: G (Chest wall, pleura, mediastinum, diaphragm, trachea, bronchus \nand lung), J (Digestive system and spleen), K (Urinary system, male genital organs and retroperitoneal space), L (Female \ngenital organs) and M (Obstetric procedures), the position 5 numeric character describes the procedure approach in the \nfollowing manner: \n\u2022 0, 3 and 6 denote: Open or otherwise co",
    "nventional approach (including blind percutaneous approach). \n\u2022 1, 4 and 7 denote: Endoscopic approach through incision or stab (including percutaneous, transvaginal, etc.). \n\u2022 2, 5 and 8 denote: Transluminal endoscopic approach (through natural or artificial body orifice). \nIn chapter F (Heart and major thoracic vessels), the same applies, with the exception that numeric characters 2, 5 and 8 are \nused for percutaneous transluminal procedures, with or without endoscopy. \nIn Chapter B (Endocrine system), where transluminal endoscopy is not an option, the position 5 numerals 1, 4 and 7 are \nreserved for percutaneous endoscopic procedures in the same manner. These are found only in group BC (Adrenal gland). \nPosition 5 numerals 0, 2, 3, 5, 6 and 8 all denote a conventional approach as described above. \nIn chapters F, G, J, K, L and M, the same position 5 numeric character is used to denote the approach for \u201cother\u201d \nprocedures with the position 4 numeric character 9. In chapters or proced",
    "ure groups where this use of position 5 to describe \nthe approach does not apply, \u201cother\u201d procedures are described by numeric characters 99 in position 4-5. \nIn chapter U (Transluminal endoscopy), and in the anatomical groups of chapters T and X relating to main chapters F, G \nand J-M, wherever appropriate, arrangement of the position 4-5 numeric characters is the same as for the corresponding \nmain chapters. \nGuidelines for classification \nGeneral guidelines \nIt is a matter of principle that each and every procedure performed should be characterised by a procedure description (code \nfrom the main or subordinate chapters A-Y) as precisely and unambiguously as possible, and always specified to the full five \nalphanumeric characters of the code. This guideline also applies to the position 4-5 numeric characters 96, 97, 98 and 99 as \ndescribed above. These codes should not be used as unspecified codes, only to characterise (new) procedures not found in the \nNCSP. However each of these cod",
    "es will encompass any number of possible procedures belonging to the procedure group \n(position 3 group) in question. \nThe supplementary codes (of chapter Z) are always appended to basic procedure codes, and may never be used alone. They \nserve only as general procedure qualifiers. \nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n \n17\nBesides the present guidelines for classification, the individual chapters are provided with detailed instructions in the form of \nshort explanatory texts \u2013 inclusions, exclusions, cross-references, pointers to additional codes. \nE.g.: \nJDD \nTotal gastrectomy \nIncludes: Omentectomy and resection of adjacent oesophagus \nIncludes: Local lymph node dissection \nAdditional code for extended lymph node dissection, see: PJD 98 \nConcurrent thoracotomy, see: GAB 10 \nConcurrent splenectomy, see: JMA 10 \nSubtotal gastrectomy, see: JDC \n \nJDD 00 \nTotal gastrectomy and Roux-en-Y oesophagojejunostomy \n \nJDD 96 \nTotal gastrectomy with other reconstruction \nIncludes: With const",
    "ruction of reservoir \n \nThe use of Includes: above denotes technical aspects or detail modifications of the procedure that fall within the procedure as \ndelimited by the code, but need not necessarily be mandatory for the use of the code. In other instances Includes: may denote \nsynonyms to the terms used in the basic code text. \nNotes on terminology \n\u2022 The code texts are descriptive and intended to be representative of the usage among surgeons in the Nordic countries. The code texts \nare however not intended to be normative for the terminology used in patient records. \nA code text has a delimiting function, often encompassing several closely related modifications of the surgical procedure, \nand is designed for the purpose of recording the activity of surgical units. The description of an operation in the patient \nrecord may be better served by the use of terms that are more specific or by terminology that is locally accepted and \npreferred in the individual surgical unit. Provided tha",
    "t the proper procedure codes are used for registration purposes, the \nNCSP does not aim at replacing surgical terminology in patient records with the basic code texts of the NCSP. \n\u2022 Open procedures are not usually specified as such in the code texts. Unless otherwise specified, an open approach is \nassumed. \n\u2022 The term \u201cexcision\u201d embraces extirpation, resection, enucleation and procedures of the same nature, and may be specified \nas partial or total. \nExcisional terms with the suffix \u201c-ectomy\u201d may be partial or total in extent, according to English usage, as opposed to \nNordic usage where the suffix \u201c-ectomy\u201d is usually reserved for total or near total excision. In the Nordic language \nversions, the terms \u201cextirpation\u201d, \u201cresection\u201d, \u201cenucleation\u201d and \u201c-ectomy\u201d should be employed when their use describes \nthe procedure in question more precisely and is consistent with established usage in Nordic surgery. \n\u2022 The term \u201clesion\u201d embraces all kinds of local tissue changes, that is tumours i",
    "n the clinical sense as well as flat tissue changes \nor defects of a neoplastic, inflammatory, traumatic or any other pathologic nature. \nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n 18 \nMatrix codes of chapters A, N and T \nThe main chapters N (Musculoskeletal system), P (Peripheral vascular system), Q (Skin), body region group AC (Peripheral \nnerves) of chapter A and group TN (Musculoskeletal system) of Chapter T, contain separate specifications for the position \n4-5 numeric characters. In chapters P and Q, the codes are fully developed, whereas in chapter N, group AC and group TN, \nmatrix codes are employed, with place-holder characters representing the numeric character in position 5 of the fully developed \ncode. The purpose of this is to make the text volume more manageable than if all possible codes were to be listed, particularly in \nchapter N. A lower-case x is used as place-holder in group AC and a lower-case y in chapter N and group TN. Lists of permitted \nnumeric substitutions f",
    "or the place-holder character of the individual code groups in question are supplied, describing the \nsignificance of each permitted numeric character. \nIt should be noted that while all place-holder substitutions listed in group AC are permitted, there are numerous possible \nsubstitutions in the individual code groups of chapter N that may define impossible or nonsensical procedures. (E.g.: In some \ncode groups it may be possible to develop a code describing medullary nailing of a bone that lacks a medullary canal, such as \nthe patella.) This possibility is not thought to be of great practical significance, as the need to classify non-existing procedures \nwill not arise. In cases of doubt, reference may be made to the complete sequential list of codes for this chapter, where non-\nexisting procedures have been excluded. Computer systems should be designed to disallow the entry of codes that are not \npresent in the complete list of codes. \nIt should also be noted that, while the charact",
    "er 9 is frequently listed as an unspecified substitute for place-holder y in \nposition 5 of chapter N codes, this merely reflects the varying level of specification frequently needed for procedures \nbelonging to the same procedure group (position 3 group) of this chapter. Its use to construct unspecified codes where \nfurther specification has been developed is not allowed, and such unspecified codes are not found in the complete sequential \ncode list for this chapter. \nCode sequence for reoperations and supplementary codes \nReoperations: The code for reoperations (character W in position 2 of the code) should always be the first code used to \ndescribe the operation and appear before the code or codes for the procedure or procedures executed during the reoperation. \nSupplementary codes: Codes from chapter Z should appear after the basic code to which the chapter Z code is appended. \nWhen more than one supplementary code is employed, ZXA-ZXD and ZZ codes, describing technical details of ",
    "the \nindividual procedure, should appear before other supplementary codes (ZXE-ZXG and ZS), describing circumstances and \nevents relating to the entire surgical session. \nE.g.: \nJCE 40 \nReconstruction of oesophagus using flap \nZZR 10 \nFlap of skin and muscle \nand optionally: \nZXD 10 \nScheduled procedure \nZXE 20 \nMore than three and less than five hours \nZXG 05 \nIntraoperative closed cardiac compression \nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n \n19\nComposite procedures and multiple procedures \nSome well established standard procedures consist of a set combination of more than one procedure that may otherwise \noccur independently. When such a standard procedure is frequent and invariably embraces the same component procedures, \nthe combined standard procedure may be allocated a basic code, as a composite procedure code. \nA composite code is equivalent to any other basic procedure code and represents its content of component procedures, which \nare not coded separately. E.g.: \nJAH 20 \nSta",
    "ging laparotomy \nWith systematic lymph node biopsies and biopsy of liver in lymphoma \nConcurrent splenectomy, see: JMA 10 \nIn this operation, the mandatory regional lymph node biopsies and liver biopsy are not coded separately. A splenectomy is \nusually, but not invariably, performed and must be coded separately. \nIn the case of lymph node excision as part of an operation where the basic procedure code does not embrace lymph node \nexcision, multiple codes are employed. \nE.g.: \nHAB 40 \nWedge excision of mammary gland \nPJD 42 \nExcision of axillary lymph nodes \nand optionally: \nZXA 00 \nRight side \nCode sequence in multiple procedures \nIf more than one procedure is executed at the same time and there is no composite procedure code covering the \ncombination, multiple codes must be registered with the main procedure code appearing first and the others in chronological \nsequence. The main procedure is the procedure that in the judgement of the surgeon is the most extensive and requires most \n",
    "of the resources employed. \nE.g.: \nGAE 30 \nRepair of combined injury to chest wall and diaphragm \nAAD 00 \nEvacuation of epidural haematoma \nEDC 35 \nClosed reduction and immobilisation of fracture of mandible \nand optionally: \nZXD 00 \nEmergency procedure \nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n 20 \nUnrelated concurrent procedures are coded as multiple procedures above. E.g.: \nJKA 20 \nCholecystectomy \nJAB 10 \nRepair of inguinal hernia \nand optionally: \nZXD 10 \nScheduled procedure \nIf supplementary codes related to individual procedures are used in multiple procedure coding, they should appear \nimmediately after the procedure to which they belong. E.g.: \nPDG 10 \nOperation on infrarenal abdominal aorta for aneurysm \nZXD 10 \nScheduled procedure \nPDE 30 \nThrombectomy or embolectomy of iliac artery \nZXD 00 \nEmergency procedure \nZXA 05 \nLeft side \nBilateral operations \nWhen the same operation is performed on both sides, the operation may be coded as two independent procedures \nsequentially o",
    "r by use of the common basic procedure code and supplementary code for bilaterality. \nE.g.: \nNBJ 51 \nInternal fixation of fracture of humerus using intramedullary nail \nNBJ 51 \nInternal fixation of fracture of humerus using intramedullary nail \n \nor: \nNBJ 51 \nInternal fixation of fracture of humerus using intramedullary nail \nZXA 10 \nBilateral \nSurgical approaches \nIn procedures where only one surgical approach is possible, a separate code for the approach (e.g.: Laparotomy, thoracotomy, \ncraniotomy) is not used. Nor should a separate code be used if the simplest or most common approach is used. If a more \nextensive approach is used, a separate code for this approach may be used. \nE.g.: \nJBC 00 \nGastro-oesophageal antireflux operation \nGAB 10 \nAntero- or postero-lateral thoracotomy \n \nRoutine for annual NCSP updates \nFormal decisions on updates are made by the Board of the Nordic Centre for Classifications in Health Care. Decisions are \nmade based on recommendations of the Nordic refer",
    "ence group for health care classifications. \nSTRUCTURE AND CLASSIFICATION GUIDELINES \n \n21\nThe Nordic reference group requires the following for taking update proposals into consideration: \n\u2022 Proposals should be approved and submitted by a responsible national classification body. \n\u2022 The proposal should include a description of the new method and an account of its indications. \n\u2022 The proposal should also include a rough estimate of how many procedures that are performed per year in the country \nsubmitting the proposal, or the expected annual number in the near future. \n\u2022 References should be included to relevant literature documenting that proposed new codes represent established \nprocedures and not purely experimental procedures. \nSometimes a submission for a new procedure code does not fulfil the above requirements. The Nordic reference group may \nfeel that the proposal is interesting, but needs further investigation. In that case, the group may choose to recommend \npostponing the de",
    "cision pending further information from the submitting body.\nNERVOUS SYSTEM \n 22 \nCHAPTER A \nNervous system \nAA \nSkull and intracranial structures \nAB \nSpinal cord and nerve roots \nAC \nPeripheral nerves \nAD \nAutonomic nervous system \nAW \nReoperations for postoperative complications in neurosurgery \nPuncture, needle biopsy and other minor procedures, see: TA \nAA \nSkull and intracranial structures \nIncludes: Pituitary gland and pineal gland \nAAA \nDiagnostic intracranial procedures \nTherapeutic implantation of stimulation or injection devices, see: AAW \nStereotactic procedures, see: AAG \nRemoval of intracranial electrodes, see: AEA \nAAA 00 \nExploratory craniotomy \nAAA 10 \nBiopsy through craniotomy \nStereotactic intracranial biopsy, see: AAG 00 \nAAA 20 \nInsertion of intraventricular pressure monitoring device \nAAA 25 \nInsertion of epidural pressure monitoring device \nAAA 27 \nInsertion of intracerebral pressure monitoring device \nAAA 30 \nInsertion of epidural electrodes \nAAA 35 \nInsertion o",

It is classified \naccording to the most common main target for the category of endoscopy in question. \nFor brevity, the terms \u201cendoscopy\u201d and \u201cendoscopic\u201d in Chapter J and Section UJ refer to transluminal \ngastrointestinal endoscopy unless otherwise specified. \nTransluminal endoscopic procedures, on the other hand, are classified in Chapter J according to the location where \nthey are actually performed. \nFor instance, endoscopic polypectomy in small intestine (JFA 05) may be performed in the course of gastroscopy, \nenteroscopy, coloscopy or ERCP. \n \nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy \nUpper gastrointestinal endoscopy (oesophagoscopy and gastroscopy) embraces endoscopic examination of \noesophagus, stomach and duodenum, and in the presence of a suitable anastomosis certain other organs, mainly sma",
    "ll \nintestine, without concurrent instrumentation of biliary tract or pancreatic duct. If the stomach or duodenal bulb are \nexamined purposely in the course of ERCP, the endoscopy should be classified as both gastroscopy and ERCP. \nUJC \nOesophagoscopy \nEndoscopic examination of oesophagus only \nIf the oesophagus is examined in the course of gastroscopy, or if examination or procedures are carried out beyond the \noesophagus, the endoscopy is classified as gastroscopy, even if the oesophagus was its main target. \nUJC 02 \nRigid oesophagoscopy \nUJC 05 \nRigid oesophagoscopy with biopsy \nUJC 12 \nFlexible oesophagoscopy \nUJC 15 \nFlexible oesophagoscopy with biopsy \nTRANSLUMINAL ENDOSCOPY \n \n269\nUJD \nGastroscopy \nBecause the stomach is its most common main target, endoscopic examination of the upper gastrointestinal tract \nbeyond the oesophagus is classified as gastroscopy, even if the oesophagus is examined as well. Oesophagoenteroscopy \nafter total gastrectomy is also classified as gastrosco",
    "py, because the method is the same, even in the absence of the most \ncommon target organ. Thus the code for gastroscopy covers (oesophago-)gastroscopy, (oesophago-)gastroduodenoscopy, \n(oesophago-)gastroenteroscopy, oesophagoenteroscopy and a few more unusual combinations \nEndoscopy with instrumentation of bile or pancreatic ducts, see: ERCP \nUJD 02 \nGastroscopy \nUJD 05 \nGastroscopy with biopsy \nIncludes: With brush cytology \nUJF \nEnteroscopy and coloscopy \nUJF 02 \nPeroral enteroscopy \nEndoscopy of adjacent small intestine in the course of gastroscopy and coloscopy, see: UJD 02 and UJF 32 \nUJF 05 \nPeroral enteroscopy with biopsy \nIncludes: With brush cytology \nUJF 12 \nEnteroscopy through intestinal stoma \nIncludes: Through ileal reservoir \nRetrograde endoscopy of ileal conduit, see: UKB 12 \nUJF 15 \nEnteroscopy with biopsy through intestinal stoma \nIncludes: With brush cytology \nUJF 22 \nIntraoperative enteroscopy \nAdditional code for enterotomy in intraoperative enteroscopy, see: JFA 00",
